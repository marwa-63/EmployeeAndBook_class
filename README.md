first I've created class Employee and book with required and methods.
I've created array of objects with size specified through the macros and declared counter for employees and books to count the recent number of them, each element of the array is object of the class so first I assigned values to it by create method also this function increment the employee or book counter.
if you want to delete elment from the array you send the index of the element to the delete function and it shifts the rest of elemnts of the array and decrement the employee or book counter.
update function recieves the updates of the object.
finally show_all display the details of the object.
